Instructions
1. We’ve defined a function with a very long name: checkThatTwoPlusTwoEqualsFourAMillionTimes.
This function takes a long time to execute. It checks whether 2 + 2 = 4, but it does it a million times (just to be really sure)!
Create a shorter-named variable, is2p2 that will be easier to work with, and assign checkThatTwoPlusTwoEqualsFourAMillionTimes as its value.

2. Invoke your is2p2() function

3. Hmmm, if we forgot the original name of our function, is there a way we could figure it out?
Use is2p2 to console.log() the name property of the function we assigned to is2p2. Check out the documentation if you need a hint.

Functions as Data
JavaScript functions behave like any other data type in the language; we can assign functions to variables, and we can reassign them to new variables.

Below, we have an annoyingly long function name that hurts the readability of any code in which it’s used. Let’s pretend this function does important work and needs to be called repeatedly!

const announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork = () => {
    console.log("I’m doing very important work!");
};
What if we wanted to rename this function without sacrificing the source code? We can re-assign the function to a variable with a suitably short name:

const busy = announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork;

busy(); // This function call barely takes any space!
busy is a variable that holds a reference to our original function. If we could look up the address in memory of busy and the address in memory of announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork they would point to the same place. Our new busy() function can be invoked with parentheses as if that was the name we originally gave our function.

Notice how we assign announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork without parentheses as the value to the busy variable. We want to assign the value of the function itself, not the value it returns when invoked.

In JavaScript, functions are first class objects. This means that, like other objects you’ve encountered, JavaScript functions can have properties and methods.

Since functions are a type of object, they have properties such as .length and .name and methods such as .toString(). You can see more about the methods and properties of functions in the documentation.

Functions are special because we can invoke them, but we can still treat them like any other type of data. Let’s get some practice doing that!
