let season = 'summer';

if (season === 'spring') {
    console.log('It\'s spring! The trees are budding!');
} else if (season === 'winter') {
    console.log('It\'s winter! Everything is covered in snow.');
} else if (season === 'fall') {
    console.log('It\'s fall! Leaves are falling!');
} else if (season === 'summer') {
    console.log('It\'s sunny and warm because it\'s summer!');

Instructions
1. Let’s create a program that keeps track of the way the environment changes with the seasons. Write a conditional statement to make this happen!
In main.js there is already an if...else statement in place. Let’s add an else if statement that checks if season is equal to 'winter'.
Inside the code block of the else if statement, add a console.log() that prints the string 'It\'s winter! Everything is covered in snow.'.

2. Add another else if statement that checks if season is equal to 'fall'.
Inside the code block of the else if statement you just created, add a console.log() that prints the string 'It\'s fall! Leaves are falling!'.

3.Add a final else if statement that checks if season is equal to 'summer'.
Inside the code block of the else if statement you just created, add a console.log() that prints the string 'It\'s sunny and warm because it\'s summer!'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Else If Statements
We can add more conditions to our if...else with an else if statement. The else if statement allows for more than two possible outcomes. You can add as many else if statements as you’d like, to make more complex conditionals!

The else if statement always comes after the if statement and before the else statement. The else if statement also takes a condition. Let’s take a look at the syntax:

let stopLight = 'yellow';

if (stopLight === 'red') {
  console.log('Stop!');
} else if (stopLight === 'yellow') {
  console.log('Slow down.');
} else if (stopLight === 'green') {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Caution, unknown!');
}
The else if statements allow you to have multiple possible outcomes. if/else if/else statements are read from top to bottom, so the first condition that evaluates to true from the top to bottom is the block that gets executed.

In the example above, since stopLight === 'red' evaluates to false and stopLight === 'yellow' evaluates to true, the code inside the first else if statement is executed. The rest of the conditions are not evaluated. If none of the conditions evaluated to true, then the code in the else statement would have executed.
